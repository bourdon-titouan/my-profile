			<h2>Hey I am Titouan Bourdon!</h2>

			<p>
			Hey I am Titouan Bourdon, I feel like I am writing a tinder bio right now so I will keep this brief. I am a 19 years old student at Essec Business School. I am from the best city on earth: <a href="https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/fr" target="_blank">Rennes</a>.I love diving, swimming and discovering new cultures but my favorite thing on earth is probably politics.

			<h2>I am a huge gamer</h2>
			<p>
			I love playing video games. I enjoy spending hours playing Rocket League with my good friend <a href="https://pierre-daverdin.github.io/my--profile/" target="_blank">Pierre</a>. I have had some of the best memories of my life playing ranked matches on Rainbow Six Siege with my friends. We almost cried when, after four years, we finally reached Platinum. As you can see, I am a big nerd.

			<h2>I love swimming</h2>
			<p>
			"I have been swimming for almost 12 years now. Yes, a gamer can also practice a lot of sports. I am kind of good at it. My record in the 50 freestyle is 26.98 seconds, which is quite impressive. But anyway, I feel better in the water than in any other environment. That's why I also do a lot of scuba diving."

		<div class="card-white">
			<h2>Politics</h2>
			<p>
			Last but not least, the thing I enjoy the most is politics. I know I may not be in the best place to have a nice and complex chat about politics on earth, but since Science-Po Paris didn't accept me, here I am. (In case someone from the administration is reading these words, I am joking. I love ESSEC and I think I am in the right place).
